    <h2>jb</h2>
    <p>Justin Drew Bieber  (/biebər/ BEE-bər; born March 1, 1994)[1][2] is a Canadian singer. Bieber is widely recognized for his genre-melding musicianship and has played an influential role in modern-day popular music.[3] He was discovered by American record executive Scooter Braun and signed with RBMG Records in 2008, gaining recognition with the release of his debut seven-track EP My World (2009) and soon establishing himself as a teen idol.

        Bieber achieved commercial success with his teen pop-driven debut studio album, My World 2.0 (2010), which debuted atop the US Billboard 200, making him the youngest solo male act to top the chart in 47 years.[4] The album spawned the internationally successful single "Baby", which became one of the highest certified singles of all time in the US, and elevated Bieber's global fandom, widely referred to as "Beliebers" — a portmanteau of Bieber and "believer".[5] His second studio album, Under the Mistletoe (2011), became the first Christmas album by a male artist to debut at number one in the US.[6] Bieber experimented with dance-pop in his third studio album, Believe (2012), and went on to become the first artist in history with five US number-one albums at age 18.[7] Between 2013 and 2014, Bieber was involved in multiple controversies and legal issues, which had a drastic impact on his public image.[8]
        
        In 2015, Bieber explored EDM with the release of "Where Are Ü Now", which won the Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronic Recording.[9][10] The song's musical direction played an instrumental role in his fourth studio album, Purpose, which produced three US number-one singles: "Love Yourself", "Sorry", and "What Do You Mean?". He became the first artist in history to occupy the entire top three of the UK Singles Chart.[11] Bieber diversified on numerous collaborations between 2016 and 2017, including "I'm the One" and his remix to "Despacito" — both reaching number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 a week apart, making him the first artist in history to chart new number-one songs in consecutive weeks.[12] "Despacito" was named the greatest Latin song of all time by Billboard and earned Bieber his career-first Latin Grammy Award. In 2019, he released a country collaboration with Dan + Shay, "10,000 Hours", which won the Grammy Award for Best Country Duo/Group Performance.[13]
        
        In 2020, Bieber released his R&B-led fifth studio album, Changes, which debuted at number one in both the UK and US, and a standalone duet with Ariana Grande, "Stuck with U", which debuted atop the US Billboard Hot 100.[14] Bieber returned to his pop roots on his sixth studio album, Justice (2021), which produced the worldwide hit "Peaches" and debuted atop the US Billboard 200, making him the youngest soloist to have eight US number-one albums, a record held previously by Elvis Presley since 1965.[15] The same year, Bieber released "Stay" with the Kid Laroi, which became his eighth US number-one single.[16]
        
        Bieber is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated sales of over 150 million records worldwide. He is credited with three Diamond certifications from the RIAA for "Baby", "Sorry" and "Despacito". He has received numerous accolades, including two Grammy Awards, one Latin Grammy Award, eight Juno Awards, two Brit Awards, one Bambi Award, 26 Billboard Music Awards, 18 American Music Awards, 21 MTV Europe Music Awards (the most wins for any artist), 23 Teen Choice Awards (the most wins for a male individual), and 33 Guinness World Records. Time named Bieber one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2011, and he was included on Forbes' list of the top ten most powerful celebrities in 2011, 2012, and 2013.[17] </p>    
     <h2>Early life</h2>
     <p>Bieber was born on March 1, 1994, at St Joseph's Hospital in London, Ontario,[18] and was raised in Stratford, Ontario.[19] He is the son of Jeremy Jack Bieber and Pattie Mallette, who were never married.[20] Mallette's mother Diane and stepfather Bruce helped her raise her son.[21] Bieber's ancestry includes French-Canadian, Irish, English, Scottish, and German.[22][23][24]

        Through his father, Jeremy, Bieber has three younger half-siblings. Jeremy and his ex-girlfriend, Erin Wagner,[25] who broke up in 2014 after seven years together, have two children, daughter Jazmyn and son Jaxon.[26] Jeremy married his girlfriend Chelsey in February 2018, and they have a daughter named Bay.[27][28] Bieber also has a stepsister named Allie, the daughter of his stepmother.[29] Pattie worked a series of low-paying office jobs, raising Bieber as a single mother in low-income housing. Bieber has maintained contact with his father.[30]
        
        Bieber attended a French-language immersion elementary school in Stratford, the Jeanne Sauvé Catholic School.[21] He graduated from high school in Stratford, Ontario, the St. Michael Catholic Secondary School, in 2012[31] with a 4.0 GPA.[32] Growing up, he learned to play the piano, drums, guitar, and trumpet.[19][33] In early 2007, aged 12, Bieber sang Ne-Yo's "So Sick" for a local singing competition in Stratford and was placed second.[33][34] Mallette posted a video of the performance on YouTube for their family and friends to see. She continued to upload videos of Bieber singing covers of various R&B songs, and Bieber's popularity on the site grew.[35] In the same year, Bieber busked shows in front of Avon Theatre steps with a rented guitar during tourism season.[36]</p>

            While searching for videos of a different singer, Scooter Braun, a former marketing executive of So So Def Recordings, clicked on one of Bieber's 2007 YouTube videos by accident.[30] Impressed, Braun tracked down the theatre Bieber was performing at, located Bieber's school, and finally contacted his mother Mallette, who was initially reluctant because of Braun's Judaism. She remembered praying, "God, I gave him to you. You could send me a Christian man, a Christian label!", and, "God, you don't want this Jewish kid to be Justin's man, do you?" However, church elders convinced her to let Bieber go with Braun. At age 13, Bieber went to Atlanta, Georgia, with Braun to record demo tapes.[30] Bieber began singing for Usher one week later.[37]
            
            Bieber was soon signed to Raymond Braun Media Group (RBMG), a joint venture between Braun and Usher.[38] Justin Timberlake was reportedly also in the running to sign Bieber but lost the bidding war to Usher, partly due to the idea that two associated Justins would confuse the market.[38][39]
            
            Usher then sought assistance in finding a label home for the artist from then manager Chris Hicks, who helped engineer an audition with his contact L.A. Reid of The Island Def Jam Music Group.[40] Reid signed Bieber to Island Records in October 2008 (resulting in a joint venture between RBMG and Island Records) and appointed Hicks as executive vice-president of Def Jam, where he could manage Bieber's career at the label.[41][35][38][40] Bieber then moved to Atlanta with his mother to pursue further work with Braun and Usher.[38] Braun became Bieber's manager in 2008.[35]
            
            Bieber's first single, "One Time", was released to radio while Bieber was still recording his debut album.[42] The song reached number 12 on the Canadian Hot 100 during its first week of release in July 2009,[35] and peaked at number 17 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States. During fall 2009, it had success in international markets.[43] The song was certified platinum in Canada and the US and gold in Australia and New Zealand.[44][45][46] His first release, an extended play titled My World, was released on November 17, 2009. The album's second single, "One Less Lonely Girl", and two promotional singles, "Love Me" and "Favorite Girl", were released exclusively on the iTunes Store and charted within the top 40 of the US Billboard Hot 100.[43] As a result, he became the first solo artist to have four singles chart in the top 40 of the Hot 100 before the release of a debut album.[47]
            
            "One Less Lonely Girl" was later also released to radio and peaked within the top 20 in Canada and the US, and was certified gold in the latter.[43] Following the release of My World, Bieber became the first artist to have seven songs from a debut album chart on the Billboard Hot 100.[48] My World was eventually certified platinum in the US and double platinum in both Canada and the United Kingdom.[49][50][51] To promote the album, Bieber performed on several live shows such as mtvU's VMA 09 Tour, European program The Dome, YTV's The Next Star, The Today Show,[52][53] The Wendy Williams Show, Lopez Tonight, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, It's On with Alexa Chung, Good Morning America, Chelsea Lately, and BET's 106 & Park. Bieber also guest starred in an episode of True Jackson, VP in late 2009.[54]
            
            Bieber performed Ron Miller and Bryan Wells's "Someday at Christmas" for former US President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama at the White House for Christmas in Washington, which aired on December 20, 2009, on US television broadcaster TNT.[55] Bieber was also one of the performers for Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest, on December 31, 2009.[56]</p>
          <h5>Voice</h5>  
          <p>Bieber initially sang with a boy soprano voice,[245] before his voice broke, as was evidenced during the debut performance of "Pray" at the 2010 American Music Awards. Sean Michaels of The Guardian described puberty as "the biggest threat to his career" at the time.[246] Jody Rosen commented that Bieber sings with "swing and rhythmic dexterity" on his debut album, noting his tone to be "nasal".[232]

            Bieber started to receive voice coaching from Jan Smith in 2008.[247]
            
            As an adult singer, Bieber's voice type is tenor, with a vocal range spanning from the baritone A2 to the high tenor F5.[248][249] In a review of his Purpose album, Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph complimented his "soft, supple and seductive singing".[250] Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian also praised Bieber's "affectedly breathy voice", noting that "the voice soon palls, but the songs are often interesting."[251</p>
